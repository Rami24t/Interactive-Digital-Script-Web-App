# Interactive-Digital-Script-Web-App
an Interactive Digital Script Web App as a support to all Actors and Theaters; 

## Concept
When an actor is reading his script while preparating or when auditioning for a role, he wants his lines in that script to be somewhat more emphasized.
This tool aims for the purpose to make noticing and reading ones' own lines in the script much easier and simpler.

This project started from my motivation to preparing efficiently for rehearsals in a play. I needed an interactive digital script webapp which can be even be a little personalised for an even smoother exper in preparation and rehearsals. So I am building it from scratch because I felt like there was nothing that matched perfectly to that need or promlem. My aim was for a clear colorful and sharp and interactive script where each role of each actor can be very easily and quickly spotted. This is a must in the field as artists need this easiness as it gives room for them to focus on their art and be as creative and motivated as possible without using their focus on telling which line is which. 
Developing this project needed and will need a lot of motivation skill and hard work and a lot of creativity skill  and combiningl nights with days. But it made a lot of hapiness too as I enjoyed doing it a lot and made with love and real motivation. 

I really hope that my works can bring ease and hapiness to others as well.
I am sure that both professionals and amatuers in the field of acting such as theaters, actors, directors, producers, associations, etc... can be interested in such a solution / and / or the services that come along with it. 
It can make the life of a lot of professionals much easier. Even script writers will want to use the oppurunity to easily market and sharply present their scripts. Directors would love an easier way to go through a script and actors of all ages can finally enjoy the clarity and efficiency that this solution provides in a easy digital and clean way.
It is really great and I think only using it in adding efficiency and clarity for the professionals during for rehearsing an act can be priceless and can add a lot the overall quality of their final product.


## Other features (so far)
- The user (such as an actor/artist/director/listener/reader/writer...) can input the name of the actors that are performing the script in order to make it even for an even easier and sharper experience (for each to swiftly spot their own lines simplifying even the long and complicated scripts and dialogues). This will add the actor's name alongside of their character's name throughout the whole script.
- The users (actors, performers, artists, directors, listeners, readers, audience, etc...) can choose their character which will automatically emphasize all his lines and close interactions through one simple click anywhere on their character's name throughout the script.
- The app is created as a web app solution that can work on all devices and screens and without even the need to install or download or install any software. Effeciency , simplicity, and easiness are at the core of this solution. 
- The app remembers your most recent valid inputs including your script, actor names, emphasized character/role/actor  and other settings 100% locally. So there is no chance for worrying even if you want to securely keep the script for yourself for as long as you wish while running it on the app.
